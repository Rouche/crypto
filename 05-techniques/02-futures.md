# 📘 What is a Futures Contract?

A futures contract is a standardized agreement between two parties to:

- **Buy or sell** a crypto asset (like BTC or ETH)
- At a **fixed price**
- On a **specific future date**

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Leverage**: You can control a large position with a smaller amount of capital.
- **Speculation**: Traders try to profit from price movements.
- **Hedging**: Protect against price volatility.

## 📈 Example

You enter a BTC futures contract to buy 1 BTC at $30,000 next month.

- If BTC hits $35,000 — you make a profit.
- If BTC falls to $25,000 — you incur a loss.

## ⚠️ Risks

- Highly volatile — can lead to liquidation (losing your position)
- Leverage amplifies both gains and losses
- Often not suitable for beginners

## 🏦 Where Can You Trade Futures?

- Centralized Exchanges: Binance, Kraken, Bybit
- Decentralized Protocols: GMX (Arbitrum), dYdX (Cosmos)

## 🔐 Are Futures Real Crypto?

No — **you don't own the actual crypto** unless you settle it. It's a **financial bet on price**.
