## 🔐 What Is Staking?

**Staking** is the process of locking up your cryptocurrency in a blockchain protocol to support network operations such as **validating transactions**, **securing the network**, or **providing liquidity** — in exchange for **rewards**.

---

### 🧩 Types of Staking

#### 1. ✅ **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Staking**
- You stake native coins (like ETH, ATOM, SOL) to help validate blocks.
- Earn rewards for helping secure the network.
- Usually done via validators.

> Example: Staking ETH through Lido or Rocket Pool.

#### 2. 💰 **DeFi Staking / Yield Farming**
- You stake tokens in a **DeFi protocol** (like Uniswap, GMX, Radiant).
- Rewards can come from fees, emissions, or lending interest.
- Higher risk, higher yield.

> Example: Staking GMX on Arbitrum to earn ETH and esGMX.

#### 3. 🌊 **Liquidity Pool (LP) Staking**
- You add two tokens into a liquidity pool and stake the LP token.
- Earn fees from trading activity + protocol rewards.
- Involves impermanent loss risk.

> Example: Staking ETH/USDC LP on Camelot.

### 🎁 What Do You Get From Staking?

- **Staking Rewards** (can be daily or periodic)
- **Voting rights** in governance protocols
- **Yield/APY** that compounds over time

---

### ⚠️ Risks of Staking

- **Lock-up Periods**: Some staking has withdrawal delays.
- **Smart Contract Risk**: In DeFi, if the protocol is hacked, funds may be lost.
- **Impermanent Loss**: Applies to LP staking.
- **Slashing**: In PoS systems, misbehaving validators can lose funds.

|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|PoS Staking|Native tokens|Low–Medium|Sometimes|
|DeFi Staking|Protocol tokens|Medium–High|Varies|
|LP Staking|Fees + rewards|High|Usually no|

## ✅ Can You Stake on Arbitrum?

Yes, **you can stake on Arbitrum**, but staking is done through specific protocols built on top of the network — not on the Arbitrum network itself.

### 🔹 Examples of Staking Opportunities on Arbitrum

|Protocol|What You Can Stake|Rewards Paid In|Notes|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|**GMX**|GMX, GLP|ETH, esGMX|Real yield from trading fees|
|**Radiant**|RDNT|RDNT, WBTC, ETH|Lending protocol with multichain support|
|**Camelot**|GRAIL, xGRAIL|GRAIL|DEX token with unique vesting mechanics|

### 🔐 How to Stake on Arbitrum (Simple Steps)

1. **Bridge tokens to Arbitrum** (e.g. via [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)).
2. Open a **DApp** like:
 - [GMX](https://app.gmx.io/)
 - [Camelot](https://app.camelot.exchange/)
 - [Radiant](https://app.radiant.capital/)
3. Connect your wallet (Rabby, MetaMask, etc.).
4. Go to the **Staking** section.
5. Approve and stake your tokens.

### 📝 Notes

- Rewards vary by protocol — often in ETH, protocol tokens, or liquidity tokens.
- Arbitrum has **low gas fees**, making it ideal for smaller-scale DeFi and staking.

## 📉 What Is Impermanent Loss?

**Impermanent loss** happens when you provide two tokens to a **liquidity pool**, and their relative prices **change** compared to when you deposited them. This can result in **less value** when you withdraw — compared to just holding the tokens outside the pool.

---

### 🧪 Example:

You provide liquidity to a **USDC/ETH** pool:

- You deposit: **$500 in ETH** + **$500 in USDC**
- ETH price doubles after some time
- When you withdraw, the pool automatically adjusts the token ratio
- You **end up with less ETH** and more USDC

If you had simply **held** ETH and USDC, you'd have **more total value**.

---

### 📌 Why It Happens

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap use a **constant product formula**:  
`x * y = k`

As people trade in the pool, the amounts of each token adjust to keep `k` constant — causing you to lose out on gains from big price swings.

---

### 🔄 Why It's "Impermanent"

The loss is only "impermanent" if the token prices **return to their original ratio**. If you withdraw while prices are still diverged, the loss becomes **permanent**.

---

### 📊 Visual Summary

| Market Action        | Impermanent Loss? |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| No price change      | ❌ None            |
| Small price change   | ✅ Small           |
| Big price change     | ✅ Bigger          |
| Prices return        | ❌ Loss disappears |
| You withdraw early   | ✅ Becomes real    |

### 🛡️ How to Reduce It

- Choose **stablecoin pairs** (e.g., USDC/DAI)
- Use **concentrated liquidity** (Uniswap v3)
- Stake in **single-token pools**
- Consider **protocols that offset IL with rewards**
