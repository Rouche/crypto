## 🎯 GOAL: Swap 0.1 ETH → USDC using Uniswap

### 🧑‍💻 What You Need:
* MetaMask installed and funded with at least 0.1 ETH + gas fees
* Internet browser (Chrome or Firefox)
* Access to https://app.uniswap.org

### 🪜 STEP-BY-STEP EXAMPLE:

#### ✅ Step 1: Open Uniswap
* Go to https://app.uniswap.org
* Click “Connect Wallet”
* Select MetaMask, confirm the connection in your wallet

#### 💱 Step 2: Choose Tokens
* In the “From” field: Select ETH
* In the “To” field: Select USDC
* Enter 0.1 ETH

Uniswap will show you:
* How many USDC you’ll receive
* The price impact
* Estimated network (gas) fee

Example:
> 0.1 ETH → 320 USDC  
> Gas fee: ~0.003 ETH  
> Slippage: <0.1%

#### 🔐 Step 3: Confirm the Swap
* Click “Swap”
* Review the transaction details in MetaMask
* Click “Confirm”

#### ⏳ Step 4: Wait for Confirmation
* In 15 seconds to a few minutes, your swap will complete
* You’ll see your USDC in your MetaMask wallet
You can also view the transaction on Etherscan.io by clicking the link Uniswap shows after the swap.

#### 🔍 What Just Happened?
* You swapped ETH into USDC
* The swap used a liquidity pool on Uniswap
* You didn’t need an exchange account
* You kept full control of your wallet and coins

#### 🧠 Bonus Tip:
* You can add USDC to MetaMask manually if it doesn’t show up. Use the USDC token contract:
