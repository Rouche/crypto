## 🧪 Example: Swap ETH → USDC on Uniswap (Arbitrum)

### 🧰 What You Need:
* MetaMask wallet with Arbitrum network added

* Some ETH on Arbitrum (for gas and swapping)

* Access to Uniswap

### 🪜 Step-by-Step (Arbitrum Version)
####  ✅ 1. Add Arbitrum to MetaMask
If it’s not already there:

1. Open MetaMask

2. Click the network dropdown → "Add network"

3. Use these details:
``` yaml
Network Name: Arbitrum One  
RPC: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc  
Chain ID: 42161  
Currency: ETH  
Block Explorer: https://arbiscan.io
```
You can also do this quickly via chainlist.org – just connect wallet and search "Arbitrum One".

#### 🪙 2. Bridge ETH to Arbitrum
If your ETH is still on Ethereum mainnet:

* Go to https://bridge.arbitrum.io

* Connect MetaMask

* Bridge some ETH to Arbitrum (e.g. 0.2 ETH)

Takes 10–15 minutes for first-time users.

#### 🔄 3. Go to Uniswap & Select Arbitrum

* Visit https://app.uniswap.org

* In the top-right, switch network to Arbitrum

* MetaMask will auto-prompt the network switch if it's set up

#### 💱 4. Swap ETH → USDC

* In From: Select ETH

* In To: Select USDC

* Enter an amount (e.g. 0.1 ETH)

Uniswap will now show:

* Estimated USDC output

* Network fee (a few cents instead of $$$!)

* Minimal slippage

#### 🔐 5. Confirm the Swap

* Click Swap → Confirm in MetaMask

* Wait a few seconds for the transaction to finalize

#### 🎉 6. You Now Have USDC on Arbitrum

* It stays in your MetaMask, but under the Arbitrum network

* You can now use that USDC on Arbitrum DeFi apps like GMX, Aave, Radiant, etc.

⚡ Why Use Arbitrum?

* 💸 Super low fees (fractions of a cent vs. ~$20 on Ethereum)

* 🔐 Same security as Ethereum (inherits its protection)

* 🧠 Great for beginners who want fast and cheap on-chain transactions
