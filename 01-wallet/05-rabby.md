* Click “Create Wallet”

* Set a strong password (write this down securely)

* ✅ Ethereum

* ✅ Arbitrum

* ✅ Polygon

* ✅ BNB Chain

* ✅ Optimism
(You can add more later)

### ✅ 4. Add Some USDC (Optional for Testing)

* Receive USDC from an ATM, exchange, or friend

* Or simulate/test with tiny amounts

Use Arbitrum or Polygon for low gas fees

* Receive funds (e.g., from ATM or on-ramp)

* Connect to DEXs like Uniswap, 1inch, or Curve
