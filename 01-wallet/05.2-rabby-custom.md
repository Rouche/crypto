# ✅ What to Do After Importing 24 Words in Rabby

### ✅ Step-by-step (Post-Import Setup)

1. **Select the First ETH Address**
   - Rabby shows multiple derived accounts.
   - The first one is usually:
     `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` → Ethereum standard path.
   - ✅ Select this to use with Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.

2. **Label It**
   - You can label this account as "Main ETH Wallet" or similar in Rabby.
   - Helps stay organized.

3. **Do NOT Use All Addresses**
   - Stick to 1–2 wallets max unless you're doing advanced multi-wallet ops.
   - More wallets = more exposure = harder backups.

4. **(Optional) Add Other Networks**
   - After selecting the ETH wallet, go to **Settings > Networks**.
   - Enable:
     - Arbitrum
     - Optimism
     - Polygon
     - BSC
     - Base
   - ✅ These are lower-fee alternatives to Ethereum mainnet.

5. **Security**
   - Lock Rabby when not in use.
   - Your 24-word seed is stored **encrypted**, but don’t trust the OS — eventually, use Trezor for storage.

6. **Backup Confirmed**
   - Make sure your 24 words are stored in KeePassXC or physically secured.

## ❗ Important Notes
* NEVER share or paste your 24 words anywhere again.

* Don't import this same seed into mobile wallets unless it's air-gapped or read-only.

* You can generate addresses for other chains (e.g., Bitcoin), but for now keep this Rabby wallet strictly for EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum-like).

## 🔁 Reusing Your 24 Words on Another Computer

To access the **same Rabby wallet on another device**, you’ll need to:

1. **Install Rabby extension** (Chrome, Brave, etc.)
2. Choose **“Import with seed phrase”**
3. Enter your **exact same 24 words**
4. Select the **same derivation path and address** (usually the first one: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`)

## 🧭 What's Happening in Rabby

When you import your **24-word seed**, Rabby scans and shows **50 standard Ethereum addresses** derived from your seed phrase.

These addresses are based on a default derivation path:

- 🔹 `m/44'/60'/0'/0/x`
- Where `x` is the index (0, 1, 2, ..., 49)

So:
- Address #1 → `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
- Address #2 → `m/44'/60'/0'/0/1`
- ...
- Address #50 → `m/44'/60'/0'/0/49`

## ✅ What to Do Now
1. **Pick address #1** (the first on the list).
   - Click “Add to Rabby.”
   - This becomes your **main wallet**.

2. **Ignore the others** unless you specifically want multiple accounts.

3. If you want to see the actual derivation path, you can:
   - Use [Ian Coleman's tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)
   - Input your seed offline (never online)
   - It will show all 50+ addresses and their derivation paths.

## 🔁 Will I See the Same Wallet Addresses on Another Computer?

✅ **Yes**, if:
- You use the **exact same 24 words**
- You select the **same derivation path** (default: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/x`)
- You’re restoring with a wallet that follows the **BIP44/BIP39** standard (Rabby, MetaMask, Trezor, etc.)

This means:
- Address #1 = `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` → will always match across devices
- Address #2 = `m/44'/60'/0'/0/1` → also same, and so on

## 📉 Rabby: Limited Derivation Path Display

- Rabby **doesn’t show the full derivation path** like `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
- Instead, it just lists addresses like:

0xAbc...1234

0xDef...5678

- These usually correspond to:

1 → m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 2 → m/44'/60'/0'/0/1

## 🔁 But you’re right: **starts at 1 in UI**, not 0 — slightly confusing.
### 🛠️ Workaround
If you want to confirm derivation paths and match addresses:

1. Go to Ian Coleman BIP39 Tool (offline)

2. Enter your 24 words (securely)

3. Scroll to Ethereum section

4. Compare the derived addresses at each index (0, 1, etc.)

5. Confirm the first Rabby address is indeed m/44'/60'/0'/0/0

### 🧩 Why It Matters
- For regular users → Rabby’s simplified interface is fine
- For security geeks or multisig setups → full derivation path visibility helps with audits or offline signing
