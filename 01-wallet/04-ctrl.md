## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Ctrl Wallet Setup
### 🔗 1. Download the Wallet Extension
Go to: https://ctrl.xyz

Click “Get Ctrl Wallet” → choose your browser:

* Chrome / Brave / Firefox

    → It installs like MetaMask or other extensions.

>✅ It's still non-custodial — keys are yours only.

### 🔐 2. Create a New Wallet
1. Click "Create New Wallet"

2. Set a strong password

3. You’ll receive a 12- or 24-word recovery phrase

4. Back it up safely

    * Write it down on paper (offline)

    * Or use KeePassXC (which you're comfortable with)

>⚠️ This phrase = access to your funds. Never share it. Never screenshot it.

### 🌐 3. Enable the Chains You Need
Go to Settings > Chains and turn on:

* 🔵 Ethereum

* 🟠 Bitcoin

* 🟣 Arbitrum

* 🟡 BNB Chain

* 🔺 Avalanche

* 🧬 Cosmos zones (optional)

>Ctrl supports over 2,100 blockchains — pick what you need to reduce clutter.

### 💰 4. Get Your Receiving Addresses
To receive crypto (e.g. from an ATM, exchange, or P2P):

1. Go to Assets tab

2. Pick a coin (e.g. USDC)

3. Click "Receive"

4. Select the network (Ethereum, Arbitrum, etc.)

5. Copy your address or scan the QR code

✅ You can now fund your Ctrl wallet.

### 🔁 5. Swap Tokens Inside Ctrl
Want to go from USDC → WBTC, or ETH → BTC?

1. Go to Swap tab

2. Choose:

    * From: USDC (Arbitrum)

    * To: WBTC (Ethereum)

3. Ctrl finds the best rate (uses 1inch, THORChain, etc.)

4. Review and confirm

>🔄 Cross-chain swaps also supported — and cheaper than MetaMask in many cases.

### 🧩 6. Connect to DeFi Apps
Ctrl supports WalletConnect + direct web integration.
To use dApps (like Uniswap, 1inch, etc):

1. Go to the dApp (e.g. uniswap.org)

2. Click “Connect Wallet”

3. Choose WalletConnect or Ctrl Wallet

4. Approve the request in your extension

You’re now ready for DeFi.

### 🔐 Optional: Boost Your Security
* Turn on auto-lock in settings

* Avoid using browser autofill

* Connect a Ledger hardware wallet (Ctrl supports it)

* Never store your seed in cloud/email/notes
