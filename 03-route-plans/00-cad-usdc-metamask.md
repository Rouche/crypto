## 🧭 Route Plan: CAD → USDC (ATM) → MetaMask
If you have an ATM that can buy USDC directly, you’ve got a super convenient and fast method to convert CAD → USDC without KYC!
### ✅ Step 1: Buy USDC at the ATM
1. Locate the ATM that supports USDC purchases directly (and allows you to buy with CAD).

2. Follow the ATM’s instructions to:

    * Deposit your CAD (usually with cash or debit)

    * Select USDC as the cryptocurrency you want to purchase

    * Confirm the transaction and wait for the USDC to be sent.

>📡 The ATM should generate a wallet address for you to receive the USDC.

### ✅ Step 2: Send USDC to MetaMask
1. Copy your MetaMask USDC wallet address:

    * Open MetaMask (ensure it's connected to the appropriate network, like Ethereum or Arbitrum)

    * Make sure you've added USDC to your MetaMask wallet.

    * Copy the USDC address in your MetaMask.

2. Input your MetaMask address in the ATM:

    * When prompted by the ATM to enter your wallet address, paste your MetaMask USDC address.

3. Confirm the transfer:

* Once everything is verified, the ATM will send the USDC to your MetaMask wallet.

### ✅ Step 3: Verify USDC in MetaMask
1. Check your MetaMask to confirm that the USDC has arrived.

    * Make sure the network matches the one you selected for the transfer (e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum).

2. Your USDC balance should now be available in your MetaMask wallet.

### 💡 Tips
* Double-check the network: If the ATM sends the USDC on Ethereum, it may be more expensive in terms of gas fees, but Arbitrum or Polygon would save on fees.

* Use a new address: If you’re concerned about privacy, always use a fresh address for each deposit.

### 🎯 TL;DR:
* Buy USDC directly at the ATM with CAD.

* Send it to your MetaMask wallet by inputting your USDC address.

* Done! You now have USDC in MetaMask, ready for swaps, DeFi, or anything else.

## ✅ Can an ATM send USDC directly to your MetaMask?
Yes — absolutely.
Most modern crypto ATMs let you provide your own wallet address, so they can send the USDC straight to your MetaMask wallet.

### 🧠 So where does the “ATM-generated address” confusion come from?
Sometimes:

* If you don’t provide a wallet address, the ATM creates a temporary one (like a paper wallet or on-screen QR code).

* But if you're prepared with your MetaMask address, you skip that step entirely.

### ✅ What YOU should do at the ATM:
1. Open MetaMask on your browser

2. Switch to your desired network (e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Polygon)

3. Click your wallet address (top center) to copy it

4. Go to the ATM and paste or scan the QR code for that address when it asks for a “destination address”

    * Many ATMs have a QR scanner

    * MetaMask lets you show a QR via mobile or extensions like MetaMask Portfolio
