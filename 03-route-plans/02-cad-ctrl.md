## 🛣️ Route Plan: CAD → USDC (on Arbitrum) → Ctrl Wallet
## ✅ Goal:
* Start with CAD in your bank

* End with USDC on Arbitrum network, inside your Ctrl Wallet

* Avoid high gas fees (Ethereum mainnet)

* Stay as private as you're comfortable with

### 🔹 Option A: Low-KYC (Canadian Exchange)

Best for simplicity + low cost

### 📌 Steps:
1. Create Account at:
* VirgoCX

* NDAX

* Kraken

>🧠 All are FINTRAC-registered and support Interac e-Transfer

2. Deposit CAD
* Use Interac e-Transfer

* Funds arrive in minutes (0–1.5% fee depending on platform)

3. Buy USDC
* Select USDC

* Make sure you’re buying on the Ethereum network

4. Withdraw USDC to Ctrl Wallet
* In Ctrl Wallet:

    * Click “Receive”

    * Choose USDC

    * Select Arbitrum network

    * Copy the address

* In exchange:

### 🔹 Option B: Crypto ATM (No KYC)
Best for privacy

2. Insert CAD & Scan Ctrl Wallet Address
* In Ctrl Wallet:

    * Go to Assets > USDC > Receive

    * Choose Ethereum or Arbitrum (depending on ATM)

    * Show QR code

* ATM will:

    * Ask for amount

    * Send USDC to your wallet

>⚠️ Some ATMs only support Ethereum mainnet, not Arbitrum

3. (Optional) Bridge to Arbitrum
If you receive Ethereum USDC, bridge it to Arbitrum:

* Use: https://www.orbiter.finance
