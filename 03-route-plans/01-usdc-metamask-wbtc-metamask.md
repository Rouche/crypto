## 🧭 Goal: Convert USDC → WBTC in MetaMask
### ✅ Step-by-Step (Recommended: Use Arbitrum or Ethereum Network)
### 🔹 Step 1: Open MetaMask and Check Network
* Open MetaMask

* Make sure you're on:

    * Arbitrum (low fees), or

    * Ethereum Mainnet (higher fees)

* Check that your USDC balance is showing

### 🔹 Step 2: Go to a DEX (Decentralized Exchange)
Best options:

* https://app.uniswap.org

* https://app.sushi.com (good for WBTC pairs)

Connect your MetaMask wallet when prompted.

### 🔹 Step 3: Choose Tokens to Swap
* From: USDC

* To: WBTC

    * If WBTC isn’t showing, paste the token address (I can get it for your network if needed)

Example for Arbitrum WBTC:
```
WBTC Arbitrum Address:
0x2f2a2543B76A4166549F7aaB2e75Bef0aefC5B0f
```

### 🔹 Step 4: Set Amount and Review
* Enter the amount of USDC you want to convert

* The DEX will show the WBTC you’ll receive

* Look at the price impact and estimated gas fee

### 🔹 Step 5: Approve and Swap
* First, you’ll need to "Approve" USDC (one-time step)

* Then click "Swap" and confirm the transaction in MetaMask

Wait for the confirmation (could take a few seconds to minutes, depending on the network).

### 🔹 Step 6: Add WBTC Token to MetaMask (if needed)
If WBTC doesn’t show up automatically:

* In MetaMask, click “Import Tokens”

* Paste the WBTC contract address for your network

* It will now show in your wallet

### 🧠 Notes:

Network|Swap Cost|Recommended?
:---|:---|:---
Ethereum|High gas ($10–$30+)|Only if needed
Arbitrum|Low gas (<$1)|✅ Best Option
Polygon|Very low|✅ Optional
Let me know:

* Which network you're on (I can give you the exact WBTC address)

* If you want to bridge to Arbitrum first (for lower fees)

* Or if you'd like me to generate a swap link for Uniswap or Sushi directly
