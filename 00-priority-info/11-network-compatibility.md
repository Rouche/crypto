## üîç Key Points:
* Arbitrum: Supports native tokens like ETH and USDC. Other assets like SOL, DOGE, and BTC are not natively supported and require wrapping (e.g., wSOL, wDOGE, wBTC) to be used on Arbitrum.

* Solana: Primarily supports native tokens such as SOL and USDC. Other assets like ETH, BTC, and DOGE are not natively supported and need to be wrapped (e.g., wETH, wBTC, wDOGE) to be used on Solana.

* Bitcoin: Supports native BTC transactions. Other assets like ETH, SOL, USDC, and DOGE are not supported natively and require wrapping or bridging to be used on the Bitcoin network.

* Ethereum: Supports a wide range of tokens, including ETH, USDC, and many ERC-20 tokens. Other assets like SOL, DOGE, and BTC are not natively supported and need to be wrapped (e.g., wSOL, wDOGE, wBTC) to be used on Ethereum.

* Polygon: Supports native tokens like ETH and USDC. Other assets like SOL, DOGE, and BTC are not natively supported and require wrapping (e.g., wSOL, wDOGE, wBTC) to be used on Polygon.

## üß† Summary:
* Wrapping Tokens: Assets like DOGE, BTC, and SOL need to be wrapped (e.g., wDOGE, wBTC, wSOL) to be used on networks where they are not natively supported.

* Native Support: Each blockchain has its own set of natively supported tokens. For example, Solana supports SOL and USDC natively, while Ethereum supports ETH and USDC natively.

* Bridging Assets: To use assets across different blockchains, you can use bridges to transfer tokens from one network to another.
