### 🧱 What is Bridging?
Bridging is the process of moving tokens from one blockchain network to another — like from Ethereum (Layer 1) to Arbitrum (Layer 2).

* It does not swap tokens (USDC stays USDC)

* It changes the chain it's on

* Purpose: to use faster & cheaper chains like Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.

### 🧾 Why It Saves on Fees (Even if ATM uses ERC-20)
You’re right:
#### ➡️ If an ATM sends USDC using Ethereum (ERC-20), that initial send uses L1 gas — no way around that.

BUT… once you bridge it to Arbitrum, you benefit going forward:

#### ✨ Here's How Bridging Saves Fees:

Action|Ethereum (L1)|Arbitrum (L2)
:---|:---|:---
Swap USDC → WBTC|~$15–40 gas|~$0.15–0.50 gas
Interact with dApps|High gas|Low gas
Claim rewards/yield|High gas|Low gas
Approve contracts|$10+ each|~$0.05
So if you do anything besides holding — you’re saving $$ long-term by moving to L2.

### 🔁 Example Flow (Bridge)
Let’s say you received 100 USDC on Ethereum (L1) in Ctrl Wallet via ATM.

#### Step-by-step:
1. Go to: https://www.orbiter.finance

2. Connect Ctrl Wallet

3. Select:

    * From: Ethereum

    * To: Arbitrum

    * Token: USDC

4. Bridge 100 USDC

5. Confirm → You'll pay one last high gas fee (maybe ~$15)

6. Done! Now your 100 USDC is on Arbitrum — forever cheap

>You now spend < $1 on every future swap, interaction, or dApp move

### 🧠 Key Tradeoff:
* Pay once high gas to escape Ethereum

* Save on every future move (Arbitrum gas is super cheap)

### TL;DR
✔️ Ctrl can receive USDC via Ethereum
✔️ Bridging is optional, but very worth it if you want to:
→ Swap USDC → WBTC
→ Use DeFi
→ Send tokens often
→ Interact with L2 apps
