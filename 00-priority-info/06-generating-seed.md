# ❓You said: Is it possible to use my own seed phrase in rabby
Yes — you can absolutely use your own seed phrase in Rabby Wallet, as long as it's a standard 12- or 24-word BIP-39 phrase.

### ✅ When Can You Use Your Own Seed in Rabby?

Situation|Supported?|Notes
:---|:---|:---
12-word seed (from MetaMask, Trust)|✅ Yes|Works perfectly, same address will appear
24-word seed (from Ledger or Trezor)|✅ Yes|Import supported, same addresses
Custom BIP-39 seed (created offline)|✅ Yes|If it's valid, Rabby can use it

### 🔄 How to Import Your Own Seed Phrase in Rabby
* Install Rabby from https://rabby.io

* Click “Import Wallet” instead of creating a new one

* Enter your 12- or 24-word phrase

* Set a password (used to unlock Rabby locally)

* Rabby will scan and restore your accounts + assets

>🧠 Rabby uses standard Ethereum derivation paths by default (m/44'/60'/0'/0), just like MetaMask and many other wallets.

### ⚠️ Important:
* Rabby stores keys locally in your browser (encrypted)

* If you're importing a valuable wallet, back it up offline

* Never enter your seed on any browser unless you fully trust the source — Rabby is open-source, but always double-check

### ✅ So yes — Rabby supports using your own existing seed phrase, and it’s a great way to bring your wallet into a more secure and DeFi-ready environment.

# ❓You said: Is it possible to create a brand new wallet with rabby with custom 24 words seed?

❌ No, Rabby does not currently let you create a new wallet using your own custom 24-word seed.

✅ But you can import a wallet that was created elsewhere using that custom 24-word phrase.

### 🔄 What You Can Do in Rabby:

Action|Supported in Rabby?|Notes
:---|:---|:---
Create a new wallet with Rabby's own seed|✅ Yes|Rabby generates a 12-word BIP-39 seed for you
Import your own 12- or 24-word phrase|✅ Yes|Works if phrase is BIP-39 compatible
Manually type 24 custom words when creating|❌ No|You can’t set a custom seed when creating inside Rabby

### 🧠 If You Want to Use a Custom 24-Word Seed:
Here’s how to do it safely:

1. Create the wallet with your custom 24-word phrase using a tool like:

    * Trezor (hardware wallet)

    * Electrum (Bitcoin desktop wallet)

    * Ian Coleman’s BIP39 tool (offline only!) (use with extreme caution, air-gapped (no external connection))

2. Import that wallet into Rabby by:

    * Clicking “Import Wallet”

    * Selecting “Import via Seed Phrase”

    * Entering your custom 24 words

    * You’ll then access your addresses in Rabby just like any other wallet.
<br />
<br />

# ❓You said: Can i create a custom 12 word seed new wallet in rabby then
❌ No, Rabby does not let you create a wallet with your own custom 12-word seed phrase.

When you create a new wallet in Rabby:

* It automatically generates a secure 12-word BIP-39 phrase for you.

* You can then back it up and use it elsewhere, but you can't choose the words yourself.

### ✅ What You Can Do Instead:
If you want full control over your seed phrase (for example, creating it from a dice roll or external tool), here's a safe method:

* Generate your custom 12-word seed using a secure, offline tool (e.g. iancoleman.io/bip39, on an air-gapped device).

* Test that phrase with a light wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet).

* Then import it into Rabby by choosing “Import Wallet” → “Seed Phrase”.

Rabby will recognize the wallet and derive your accounts normally.

### 🔐 Why This Matters:
Allowing users to input their own seed when creating a wallet increases risk if done wrong. Rabby skips that to keep users safer — but still supports importing externally created wallets.

# ❓You said: Step-by-step on generating your own 12-word phrase safely
Perfect — here’s how to safely create your own 12-word seed phrase and use it with Rabby.

## 🛠️ STEP-BY-STEP: Create Your Own 12-Word Wallet (Secure + Offline)
### ✅ What You'll Need:
* An offline computer (or live boot Linux/USB)

* The BIP39 tool — downloaded and run offline only

* A secure way to store your seed (paper, metal backup, etc.)

### 1️⃣ Download the BIP39 Generator (Offline Use)
* Visit https://iancoleman.io/bip39 ONLY TO DOWNLOAD

* Scroll down and click “Offline Version”

* Save the .html file to your computer

* Disconnect from internet / airplane mode
(ideally, use a computer never connected again)

### 2️⃣ Open the Tool and Generate Your Seed
Open the bip39.html file locally (no internet)

Choose:

* 12 words

* Language: English

* Click “Generate”

It shows a random 12-word phrase like:
```
velvet onion collect test silk carbon inner mobile spring leaf toe luxury
```

### 3️⃣ (Optional) Add a Passphrase
* Scroll to the "BIP39 Passphrase" section (this is the optional 25th word).

* Only use this if you understand how to recover it later — it changes the wallet entirely.

### 4️⃣ Write Down and Verify Your 12 Words
* Write the 12 words by hand

* Triple check spelling and word order

* Do not save it digitally or online

### 5️⃣ Test in Rabby Wallet
* Go to https://rabby.io and install the extension

* Click “Import Wallet”

* Paste or type your 12-word custom seed phrase

* Rabby will load your wallet with ETH-compatible addresses

### ✅ Done — you now have a Rabby wallet from a fully self-generated seed.

# ❓You said: Whats the difference between offline bip39 and just using import with my random words
That’s a really important question — and the difference is huge for your security.

## ⚠️ Difference: True Offline Generation vs. Online Import

Method|Is It Safe?|Risk Level|What Happens
:---|:---|:---|:---
✅ Offline BIP39 tool (air-gapped)|Very Safe|🔒Low|You generate your wallet with no internet, no third party involved
❌ Typing random words into Rabby|Not Safe|🚨 High|Rabby only accepts valid phrases — but it’s online, so your phrase could be exposed

### 🧠 Why It Matters
Wallets are deterministic: your 12-word phrase = your entire wallet

If you type those 12 words while connected to the internet, even in a secure app, there is always a **risk of:

* Malware/keyloggers

* Browser vulnerabilities

* Rogue extensions

* Phishing clones**

## ⚔️ Common Mistake
"I'll just make up 12 words and import them into Rabby."

### 🔴 Bad idea. Unless they come from a proper BIP-39 wordlist, they:

* Might not generate valid private keys

* May not be accepted by Rabby or any wallet

* Could expose you to seed phrase rejection or loss of funds

### ✅ Solution: Use an offline, verified BIP-39 generator
You get:

* Proper cryptographic entropy

* BIP-39-compliant phrases

* Full control, no one ever sees the seed but you

# ❓You said: Can i use random strings generated in keepass?
Technically, yes, you can use random strings generated in KeePass — but there are a few important caveats to be aware of, especially if you're aiming for full compatibility with most crypto wallets (including Rabby, MetaMask, etc.).

### ⚠️ Why Using Random KeePass Strings Might Not Be Ideal:
1. Not BIP-39 Compatible:

    * Most wallets (like Rabby) expect 12 or 24 words derived from a BIP-39 wordlist, not a random string of characters.

    * BIP-39 words come from a specific list of 2048 words (with checksums), ensuring cryptographic randomness and security.

    * Random strings in KeePass won’t be valid BIP-39 phrases, and they might not produce recoverable wallets.

2. Lack of Human-Readability:

    * While KeePass can generate random strings of characters (which is excellent for secure passwords), these strings aren't human-readable and aren't backed by the wordlist that most crypto wallets rely on.

    * Using random characters directly would make the wallet impossible to recover without the original string.

### ✅ What You Can Do:
Generate a Random Phrase Using KeePass:

* Use KeePass to generate a random 12- or 24-word passphrase from the BIP-39 wordlist (it’s built into KeePass plugins).

* Use a Proper BIP-39 Phrase:

After generating a random 12 or 24-word passphrase in KeePass (properly adhering to BIP-39 standards), you can import it directly into Rabby or any other wallet.

### 🔧 How to Use KeePass for BIP-39-Compatible Phrase:
* Download KeePass (if you haven’t already).

* Install a KeePass plugin for generating BIP-39 phrases, such as the KeePassCrypto plugin.

* Use this plugin to generate a secure 12- or 24-word passphrase.

* Record the generated phrase on paper (or metal) — NOT digitally.

### ✅ Best Option:
Instead of using random KeePass strings, use a proper BIP-39 wordlist generator (offline), such as the BIP39 tool or Trezor’s method for generating secure seed phrases.

### ⚠️ Don't Use Random Non-BIP-39 Strings:
If you do not adhere to BIP-39, the wallet won't recognize your seed, and your funds will be unrecoverable.

# ❓You said: If there is only 2048 words on BIP39, there is surrelly gonna be collisions or duplicate wallet generation
Great question! You're absolutely right to think about collisions — and I can clarify this for you.

### 🧠 BIP-39 and Collisions:
The BIP-39 standard uses a 2048-word wordlist for generating 12- or 24-word seed phrases, but this doesn’t lead to collisions or duplicate wallets in practice due to the vast key space and cryptographic properties involved.

### 🔐 Why No Collisions?
#### Huge Key Space:

* BIP-39 phrases are not just about picking random words from a list. Each word represents 11 bits of entropy.

* A 12-word seed phrase creates 132 bits of entropy (12 words x 11 bits).

* A 24-word seed phrase creates 264 bits of entropy (24 words x 11 bits).

#### Key space comparison:

* 12-word phrase: 2^132 ≈ 5.3 x 10^39 possible combinations

* 24-word phrase: 2^264 ≈ 1.8 x 10^79 possible combinations

>Even with a limited wordlist of 2048 words, the number of possible seed phrases is so astronomically large that the chance of collisions (i.e., the same seed phrase being generated twice) is effectively zero in any practical scenario.

#### Checksum:

* Each BIP-39 phrase has a checksum built into the last word. This ensures the phrase is valid and helps prevent errors during creation or typing.

* The checksum is generated by hashing the entropy, and it’s part of what makes sure your 12/24 words create a valid wallet. This further reduces the possibility of collisions.

#### Cryptographic Entropy:

* The randomness used to generate BIP-39 phrases comes from high-quality cryptographic sources, ensuring that the combination of words is unique and highly unlikely to repeat by chance.

#### Not Just Word Selection:

* The final wallet’s private key and public address are derived from the hash of these seed phrases, which means the combination of entropy (randomness) and hashing ensures that the address space is huge and non-repetitive.

### 🛡️ Practical Implications:
Even though there are only 2048 words in the BIP-39 list, the number of possible combinations is so vast (as noted above) that there are essentially no duplicates. The entropy combined with the checksum makes it extremely unlikely that two people will generate the same wallet, even if they're using the same wordlist.

# ❓You said: So if i use BIP39 tool and its not connected. how does it creates the wallet?
Amazing follow-up — and you're asking exactly the kind of question that leads to true understanding. Let’s break this down simply:

## 🔐 How Does the BIP39 Tool Create a Wallet Offline?
When you're using the BIP39 tool offline, you're not connecting to any blockchain or wallet service. Instead, it works purely with math and cryptography — all locally in your browser.

Here’s what happens under the hood:

### 🧠 Step-by-Step (Simplified):
Entropy is Generated
1. The tool starts by generating a block of random data (called "entropy") — for example:

    * 128 bits (for 12 words)

    * 256 bits (for 24 words)

2. Entropy → Seed Phrase (Words) The tool converts that entropy into a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase (12 or 24 words).
    * These words are selected based on binary positions in the official 2048-word list.

    * Adds a Checksum A checksum (based on a hash of the entropy) is added to ensure the phrase is valid and not mistyped.

    * Mnemonic → Seed The 12/24-word phrase is converted into a binary seed using a process called PBKDF2 (a key stretching function with 2048 rounds of SHA-512 hashing).

3. Seed → Private Key(s) From this seed, the tool can derive:

    * Master Private Key

    * From which many wallet addresses (BTC, ETH, etc.) can be generated using derivation paths like:

        * m/44'/0'/0'/0 for Bitcoin

        * m/44'/60'/0'/0 for Ethereum

### 🚫 No Internet Needed
None of these steps require internet because:

* The math is deterministic (you get the same result every time from the same phrase)

* The tool is just applying well-known cryptographic functions, not accessing any server

### 🛡️ That’s Why It’s Secure
* No external input = No backdoor

* No one sees your seed but you

* You can verify all steps with open-source code

### 🔄 From Words to Wallet
Once you get your 12/24-word phrase:

* You can import it into Rabby, MetaMask, Trezor, etc.

* All of them will generate the same wallet addresses from that seed.

# ❓You said: Can i use a temporary Linux inside Windows to create a custom BIP39 wallet?
Yes, absolutely — and that's actually a smart and secure approach! Here's how you can do it safely:

## ✅ Yes: You Can Use Temporary Linux in Windows for BIP39 Wallet Creation
### 🔐 Best Practice: Use a Live Linux USB
A “live” Linux session means it runs from USB without touching your hard drive, and everything disappears when you shut down — ideal for creating secure wallets.

### 🧰 Tools You’ll Need:
* A USB stick (at least 4 GB)

* A trusted Linux ISO (like Ubuntu, Debian, Tails, or Linux Mint)

* Rufus (or BalenaEtcher) to write the ISO to USB

* An offline version of the BIP39 tool (download ZIP from GitHub)

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Create a Bootable USB:

    * Download a Linux ISO (e.g., Ubuntu or Tails)

    * Use Rufus or Etcher on Windows to burn the ISO to your USB

2. Prepare BIP39 Tool:

    * Download the full BIP39 tool ZIP from GitHub: iancoleman/bip39

    * Save it to another USB drive or the same one if space allows

3. Boot into Linux (Live Mode):

    * Restart your computer, boot from the USB

    * Choose “Try Linux” or “Live Session” (do not install)

4. Open BIP39 Tool Offline:

    * Open the downloaded bip39-standalone.html file in the Linux browser

    * Disable Wi-Fi / unplug Ethernet

    * Generate your 12 or 24-word seed completely offline

5. Record Your Seed:

    * Write it down by hand or store it in a KeePass file on air-gapped USB only

    * Never take a screenshot or photo

6. Shut Down Linux:

    * When done, shut down the live session — all memory and temporary files are erased

### 🔒 Why This Is Secure:
* No trace on Windows

* No malware/keyloggers can touch your seed

* Your phrase never hits the internet
<br />
<br />

# ❓You said: Well its pretty impossible to keep it off windows since you have to import it in Rabby after
You're totally right — importing into Rabby (which runs in your regular browser on Windows or macOS) means your seed will eventually touch that system. But here's how you can still do it securely:

### ✅ Safe Workflow (Even with Windows):
1. Generate the Seed Phrase Offline (in Live Linux)

    * You isolate the most sensitive part: seed creation.

    * No exposure to online threats or malware.

2. Write Down or Encrypt the Seed

    * Write by hand or store in an encrypted KeePassXC file (on a USB drive only).

    * Don't copy-paste the seed phrase directly.

3. Boot Back into Windows

    * Open Rabby (browser extension)

    * Choose “Import Wallet” → “Seed Phrase”

    * Type the 12/24 words manually (don’t paste)

### 🔐 Why This Is Still Safe:
Even though Rabby is in Windows:

* You're reducing risk by isolating generation from online exposure.

* You’re not relying on Windows to generate randomness (which could be weaker or infected).

* Once imported into Rabby, you can transfer funds to a Trezor later for full cold storage.

### 🔄 Optional: Temporary Use Only
If you're paranoid (like many crypto veterans):

* Use Rabby only temporarily

* Create the wallet → move funds → secure everything in Trezor

* Wipe the Rabby wallet from your browser

## 🔥 Stealth Method: Custom Fields Trick
Instead of saving your 24 words as plain text (where it's obvious that it's a wallet backup),
you can split and hide the words inside the KeePassXC database using Custom Fields.

Here’s exactly how:

### 1. Create a new KeePassXC entry (like normal)
* Example Title: "Project Notes" or "SSH Keys" (something boring, not "Seed Wallet")

* Username: leave blank or put a dummy name

### 2. Instead of putting the seed in the password box:
* Click on "Add a New Attribute" (custom field).

* Add 12 custom fields.

    * Each custom field holds 2 words.

    * Example:

        * Field 1: "tree cat"

        * Field 2: "planet winter"

        * etc.

### OR

* Add 24 custom fields.

    * One word per field for even more mixing.

### 3. Use harmless-looking field names:
* Don't name the fields "Seed Word 1", "Seed Word 2", etc.

* Instead use fake names like:

    * Note1

    * KeyAlpha

    * Memo3

    * AccessPoint

    * etc.

### 4. Save the database normally
* Now if someone ever steals your KeePassXC file, they won’t immediately know these are seed words.

* It just looks like random small notes.

### ⚡ Example Visual:

Field Name|Value
:---|:---
Note1|tree
Memo4|cat
RefID|planet
KeySetA|winter
...|...

### 🛡️ Why is this more secure?
* No obvious "Bitcoin Wallet" or "Crypto Backup" written anywhere.

* No giant 24-word block that looks suspicious.

* Attackers need both access AND knowledge of how you organized it.

>✅ You can even encrypt KeePassXC database with a VERY strong master password and store it offline (USB key).

# ❓You said: That ian coleman tool, seems to not have USDC as coin
You're right — and that's normal.

## 🧠 Why you don't see USDC in Ian Coleman BIP39 tool:
* Ian Coleman's tool is for generating addresses and keys based on blockchains, not tokens.

* USDC is not a blockchain — it's a token that lives on a blockchain (like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.).

### ✅ So USDC lives inside your Ethereum address (or Arbitrum address, etc).

You don’t need a different seed or address for USDC.
### 👉 You need a wallet that supports the blockchain where USDC is deployed.

Example:

* Your Ethereum address 0xABC... holds both ETH and USDC tokens.

* Same address, same private key.

### 🧩 Summary

What Ian Coleman shows|What actually happens
:---|:---
Bitcoin address|Your BTC wallet
Ethereum address|Your ETH wallet (and all tokens inside: USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.)

#### ✅ As long as you generate an Ethereum-compatible address, you can use it to hold USDC.
#### ✅ No need for a separate "USDC wallet".

### ✍️ Quick Tip:
When you import your 24 words into Rabby, it will detect your ETH address and automatically find your USDC token balances by scanning the address.

Would you like me to show you how to safely verify that your generated address works for USDC before moving money?
(only takes 1-2 minutes and saves big mistakes) 🚀

# ❓You said: so wich coin i choose when generating a wallet?
💬 Very good, let's keep it 100% practical:

When you generate a wallet (with BIP39 tool or others) and you must choose a coin, here’s what you do:

## 🛡️ Correct answer:
### 👉 Choose "Ethereum" (ETH) when generating if your main goal is to store:

* ETH itself

* USDC (on Ethereum)

* USDT

* Other ERC-20 tokens

* Interact with DeFi apps (Uniswap, etc.)

#### ✅ 1 Ethereum address = holds all Ethereum-based tokens.
#### ✅ That same address works for USDC.

### 🧠 Deeper explanation:

If you want to store...|You generate wallet for...
:---|:---
BTC|Bitcoin (BTC)
ETH, USDC, DAI, Tokens|Ethereum (ETH)
SOL|Solana (SOL)
ARB, OP, etc|Usually still Ethereum (then bridge later)

## ⚡ Ultra simple guide:

Your Goal|Coin to choose for generation
:---|:---
Hold BTC|Bitcoin
Hold USDC	Ethereum
Play DeFi (ETH)|Ethereum
Play DeFi (SOL)|Solana

### ✅ So for your case right now:
### ➡ Choose “Ethereum” in Ian Coleman when generating.

That will give you the proper addresses for Rabby, USDC storage, swaps, DeFi, etc.
