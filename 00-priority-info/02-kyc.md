# 🪪 What Is KYC?
KYC stands for Know Your Customer.

It’s a process where financial institutions (like crypto exchanges) verify your identity before you can use their services.

### 📋 What KYC Usually Requires:
To complete KYC, you'll typically need to provide:

* 🧑 Full Name

* 🪪 Government-issued ID (e.g., passport, driver’s license)

* 🏠 Proof of address (e.g., utility bill or bank statement)

* 📸 A selfie (sometimes holding your ID)

### 🏦 Why Do Companies Ask for KYC?
Because of regulations. KYC is required to:

* Prevent money laundering

* Stop terrorist financing

* Comply with local laws (like FINTRAC in Canada 🇨🇦)
