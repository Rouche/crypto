## 🛣️ Your Privacy Path: CAD Cash → BTC → ETH → USDC → Trust Wallet
### ✅ Step 1: Buy BTC with Cash (No KYC)
Use a Bitcoin ATM near you.

1. Go to https://coinatmradar.com

2. Filter by "No verification" and your city

3. Choose a machine that accepts cash

4. Send BTC directly to your Trust Wallet BTC address

📌 In Trust Wallet:

* Tap “Receive”

* Select Bitcoin

* Show the QR code to the ATM

>🧠 Tip: Start small (e.g., $100) to test the process

### 🔁 Step 2: Swap BTC to ETH or USDC (Non-KYC)
Now that you have BTC, we’ll get it onto a DEX-compatible network.

#### Option A: Use THORChain (via Trust Wallet)
Trust Wallet supports THORChain in-app swaps:

1. Tap BTC → Tap "More" → Tap “Swap via THORChain”

2. Choose ETH or USDC as the output

3. Confirm the swap (it uses cross-chain liquidity)

>🎯 You’ll now have ETH or USDC on the Ethereum Mainnet

### 📉 Step 3: Bridge ETH or USDC to a Cheap Chain
To avoid Ethereum gas fees, bridge to a lower-cost network like Arbitrum or Polygon.

Use:

* https://bridge.arbitrum.io

* https://app.synapseprotocol.com

* https://www.orbiter.finance (fast + cheap)

Make sure you add the destination network to Trust Wallet if it isn’t there.

### 🛠️ Step 4: Use DEXs to Trade Freely
Now you're on a cheap and private chain, and can use:

* Uniswap (Arbitrum, Polygon, or Ethereum)

* 1inch – aggregator for best rates

* CowSwap – MEV-resistant DEX

All work directly from Trust Wallet via WalletConnect, no KYC, no account.

### 🧾 Optional: Privacy Enhancers
Want to hide the trail?

* Use Railgun on Arbitrum (shielded private transactions)

* Use Samourai Wallet + Whirlpool if you're BTC-focused
