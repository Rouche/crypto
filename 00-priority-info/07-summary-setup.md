# 🛡️ 2-Wallet Security Plan

Purpose|Wallet|Chain(s)|24-word seed|Notes
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
DeFi, ETH, USDC, fast trades|Rabby Wallet (desktop)|Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.|Seed #1 (you already made it offline)|Keep a copy safe. Can be used with MetaMask-compatible apps if needed.
Bitcoin HODL (safe storage)|Trezor Model T (hardware)|Bitcoin (BTC)|Seed #2 (new one generated directly on Trezor)|No exposure to Rabby or browser wallets. Maximum cold storage safety.

## 📦 How to Execute Step-by-Step:
1. ✅ Today:

    * Finalize Rabby setup using your Seed #1.

    * Use Rabby for USDC, ETH, fast DeFi.

2. 🔜 When Trezor arrives:

    * Plug Trezor → Create a NEW 24-word seed inside the device.

    * Write it down securely (NO PC ever sees it).

    * Use Trezor to receive Bitcoin directly (no browser wallet needed).

3. 🔒 Long-Term:

    * Keep Rabby wallet light (no huge amount).

    * Keep large Bitcoin amounts only in Trezor.

    * Periodically move DeFi profits from Rabby to Trezor if you want even higher security.

## 🧠 Why This Is Very Powerful:
* If Rabby gets hacked or a browser fails ➔ Your Bitcoin is unaffected.

* If Trezor gets damaged ➔ Your ETH/USDC still work.

* If you die / lose ➔ You can still plan backup instructions separately for each wallet (later if you want).

## 🎯 Quick Visual:
```
[ Seed #1 (Rabby) ]
   └── DeFi / ETH / USDC / Altcoins (Hot Wallet)

[ Seed #2 (Trezor) ]
   └── Bitcoin (BTC) Cold Storage (Ultra Secure)
```

## ⚡ Bonus tip:
When you generate the Trezor seed, you don't need Ian Coleman or anything.
Trezor generates it inside the hardware → real offline entropy, very safe.

### ✅ You now have a real professional-grade setup plan.
