# ❓You said: I see a Scam tx air drop in my transactions what is this
You're seeing a scam airdrop transaction, which is unfortunately very common on public blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrum. These fake airdrops are designed to trick users into interacting with malicious contracts or phishing sites.

## 🚨 What Is a Scam Airdrop?
### 🔍 Characteristics
* Appears in your wallet history as a token you didn’t expect or recognize.

* May have a name like: FreeAirdrop, RewardToken, ClaimNow, or even impersonate legit tokens like USDT, Uniswap, etc.

* metimes has links in the transaction memo or token description (NEVER click those).

* Clicking or attempting to swap the token can give the scammer access to your wallet or trick you into signing a malicious transaction.

## 🧼 What To Do (And Not Do)
### ✅ Safe Actions
* Ignore it. It’s just spam — you don't need to delete or report it.

* Hide the token in your wallet (Rabby and MetaMask allow this).

* If unsure, you can check the token contract on:

    * https://polygonscan.com (for Polygon)

    * https://arbiscan.io (for Arbitrum)

### ❌ Never Do This
* ❌ Don’t try to transfer, swap, or approve the token.

* ❌ Don’t click any link or website associated with the airdrop.

* ❌ Don’t connect your wallet to unfamiliar dApps that mention the token.

### 🧱 Why It Happens
Anyone can send a token to your address — blockchains are public. Scammers use this to:

* Bait you into visiting malicious dApps

* Trick you into approving token interactions that drain your wallet

## 🛡️ Final Tip
You're safe as long as you don't interact with the scam token or site. Just ignore or hide it.
