# ❓You said: What is a dApp
A dApp (short for decentralized application) is an app that runs on a blockchain instead of centralized servers. It interacts directly with your crypto wallet and smart contracts — no username, password, or middleman required.

## 🧠 In Simple Terms

Regular App|dApp
:---|:---
Runs on company servers|Runs on blockchain (e.g., Ethereum)
Login with email/password|Connect with your wallet (e.g., Rabby, MetaMask)
Controlled by a company|Controlled by smart contracts (code)

## ✅ Examples of dApps

Type|dApp Examples
:---|:---
DeFi (finance)|Uniswap, Aave, Curve
Bridges|Jumper, Rango, Stargate
Games|Decentraland, Axie Infinity
Marketplaces|OpenSea (NFTs)
Wallet tools|Revoke.cash, Gas Bank

When you visit one, your wallet (like Rabby) may prompt you to connect — that’s how dApps know who you are (your wallet address) and let you interact.


# ❓You said: Should i disconnect from echange after using them
Yes — you should absolutely disconnect your wallet from exchanges and dApps after using them. It’s a good security habit.

## ✅ Why You Should Disconnect
Even if trusted platforms don’t have access to your funds, staying connected can:

* Expose your wallet to tracking (IP, balances, activity)

* Allow auto-requests (e.g., token approvals, gasless transactions)

* Create risk if the site is ever compromised

## 🔒 How to Disconnect in Rabby
1. Open Rabby Wallet.

2. Click the “Connected Sites” icon (usually a plug 🔌 or link symbol).

3. Find the exchange or dApp (like Kraken, Jumper, QuickSwap, etc.).

4. Click Disconnect next to its name.

Do this after every session, especially with:

* Bridges

* DeFi platforms

* Exchanges

* Airdrop claim sites

## 🧠 Tip: Also Revoke Token Approvals
If you’ve approved USDC or any token:

* Visit https://revoke.cash

* Connect your wallet

* Revoke any unnecessary or unlimited token approvals
