## ✅ How to Verify Your Wallet On-Chain
1. Find Your Wallet Address
In Rabby (or any wallet), copy your public address — it looks like:

```0xABCD...1234```

or for Bitcoin:

```bc1qxyz...abc```

2. Use a Blockchain Explorer

| Network  | Explorer                          | Example URL                            |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ethereum | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) | `https://etherscan.io/address/0x...`   |
| Arbitrum | [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io)   | `https://arbiscan.io/address/0x...`    |
| Bitcoin  | [Mempool](https://mempool.space)  | `https://mempool.space/address/bc1...` |
| Base     | [Basescan](https://basescan.org)  | `https://basescan.org/address/0x...`   |

3. Paste Your Address
* See your balance, tokens, NFTs, and all transactions

* Confirm if a transaction went through (e.g., "Success" or "Failed")

* View incoming/outgoing transfers
